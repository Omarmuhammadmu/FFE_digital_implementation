# FFE_digital_implementation
The implementation of a FFE using only one adder and one multiplier. Specifications include a 1 MHz input data frequency and a 4 MHz FFE clock frequency, with the output being a 12-bit signed value available every 4 FFE clock cycles. The paper details the design, provides pseudo code, Verilog code, the Verilog netlist, and suggests optimizations.
